# IMLFinalProj

This is a final project by Ethan Mathieu, Taimur Moolji and Diego Aspinwall for CPSC381 at Yale University. This repo is intended to be submitted alongside the official writeup. The project goal, summarized:

> To verify that ETFs are a viable solution to idiosyncratic risk, the purpose of this project will be to construct a market-cap weighted portfolio of oil companies, and then build a model that predicts the value of this portfolio based on where oil prices are.

To run this .ipynb file:

0. 'git clone' the repository
1. 'pip install' any new packages, such as 'yfinance'
2. run all cells in 'final_proj.ipynb'

Note that since this code is deterministic, so you should get the same results as us.

Please see the code comments for further information and reach out to taimur.moolji@yale.edu, ethan.mathieu@yale.edu or diego.aspinwall@yale.edu with any questions.
